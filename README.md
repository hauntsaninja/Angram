Angram

This poorly named piece of software was an attempt my younger self made to
recreate Anagram Artist
(<http://www.anagrammy.com/resources/anagram_artist.html>). The code quality
reflects the indiscretions of my past self, but you should find it to be fully
functional, apart from the parts of speech checkboxes. I attribute this to the
laziness of my younger self; the laziness of my current self is what keeps this
from being a reality today.

I believe the dictionaries are derived from SCOWL
(<http://wordlist.aspell.net>), although I am not sure.

Here is a screenshot:
